Description: First, I learn cocos2d, Box2d and OpenGLES from the above link. There are some hints and materials(images) to help me organize this project. Then, I do it myself. I complete nearly 100%. Very tired but so happy to learn a lot of new skills, I'm appreciate this practice chance. If I have more time, I want to create more gamescene.
